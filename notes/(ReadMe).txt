You can put any files that you want to share with a link in here. Then commit and push onto Github. These file can only be accessed by people with the link. The file is not "searchable" and won't be indexed by any browser (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo!).

Suppose you want to share the file name "myVideo.mp4", after you put the video into this folder and commit, this video can be accessed from the following link https://shilongsun.github.io/notes/myVideo.mp4
