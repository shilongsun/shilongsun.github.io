(ReadMe)

You can put any files that you want to "share it with a link" in here. Then commit and push onto GitHub. These files can only be accessed by people with the link. The files are not "searchable" and won't be indexed by any browser (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo!).

The files are searchable "only if" you explicitly put "the link to the file" anywhere on the Internet (your webpage, Facebook) etc.

Suppose you want to share the file name "myVideo.mp4", after you put the video into this folder and commit, this video can be accessed from the following link https://shilongsun.github.io/notes/myVideo.mp4

You can also add any other folder into you GitHub folder. They will appear as https://shilongsun.github.io/folderName
